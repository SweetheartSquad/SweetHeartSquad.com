BLOOD in the SKY: DEAD or ALIVE is a story-driven mech battler inspired by the board game Battleship. Build your mech using a variety of weapons, shields, and parts. Locate and destroy your opponent's cockpit before they get yours.

You are SONGBIRD, an up-and-coming mech fighter. You're having a casual match in the arena with your friend when everything changes. Rumours are exchanged, friendships are tested, and relationships are strained; but in the end, family is everything.

Made by Sean, Michael, and IAN for [MechJam V](https://itch.io/jam/mechjam5).

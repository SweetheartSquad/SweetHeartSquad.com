You've been working on your game jam for hours. You decide to take a walk to clear your head. Explore the illustrious Carleton University campus, lovingly recreated in 2.5D... Meet strange new friends... See what kinda weird trash the students have left lying around. The spiritual successor to "Super Solvers: Midnight Rescue!" without the robots or the educational value.

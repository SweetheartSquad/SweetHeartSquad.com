TODO: full page description



You've been waiting for your bus. And waiting. And waiting. And now  you're dead! Your soul is being drawn toward the afterlife, but you have  to fight the urge. You can't <em>die</em> -- you have to get to <strong><em>WORK!!</em></strong>&nbsp;

Prevent your ghost from floating to the top of the screen until your bus comes. To pass the time, listen in on other people's conversations.

---

Controls:

- Press, hold, and drag on the ghost to move
- Press and hold text to read

Fullscreen recommended.

> How is the bus still not here? You've been waiting for a really, REALLY long time. It should of been here ages ago.

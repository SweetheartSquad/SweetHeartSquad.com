<h1>Welcome to Finder's Keplers!</h1>
<p>This is an asynchronous multiplayer game for 2 or more players. Draw constellations using the generated prompts/starmap, and then send them to your friends and see if they can guess them all!</p>
<h2>Instructions for DRAWER:</h2>
<p>You are given a collection of random names, and need to draw constellations based on each. If you don't like the names you got, then click "Re-roll" in the bottom right of the screen to get new ones.</p>
<h3>To draw:</h3>

1. Click one of the names in the list.
2. Click a star on the map to start a constellation.
3. Click another star to draw a line between that star and the precious star.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you're done with the constellation.
5. When you're done adding stars to the constellation, click another name in the list.
6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 until you've drawn one constellation for each name.

<p>When you've drawn all of the constellations, you can send a link to one or more GUESSERS, and they'll try to match your constellations to the names.</p>
<p>To share a link to your GUESSER(s), click one of the "Share" buttons below the list of names. You can open the link to your constellations, tweet the link, or copy the link to your clipboard. Send this link to one or more people and ask them to match the names!</p>
<p>The more constellations your GUESSER(s) gets right, the better you all did!</p>
<h2>Instructions for GUESSER:</h2>
<p>The DRAWER drew constellations based on the given names, and then sent you a link.</p>
<p>Now you have to guess which name goes with which constellation.</p>

1. Click one of the names in the list.
2. Click on the constellation that you think matches the name.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all names.
4. Click "Confirm matches".

<p>You'll see your score out of the total. Try to get all of them correct!</p>
<p>Good luck!<br></p>

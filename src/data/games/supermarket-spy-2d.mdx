You're Agent 14, a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed ingenue at B.E.S.T. (Best Espionage Surveillance and Tactics), and you've just received your first real mission in the field. Use all your training to successfully infiltrate a location and intercept a top-secret communique from G.R.I.M. (Gun-Running & Intelligence Merchants).

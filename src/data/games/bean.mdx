BEAN is based on an old swimmer's game. It's a regular old swimming race -- but if you finish with the bean, you lose! Swap lanes with other players to get rid of the bean.

Keyboard controls are available, but gamepads are highly recommended!

How to play:
Finish your laps first and avoid the bean.
You can "swap" with another player to switch lanes with them or give them the bean. If you press "swap", then you will swap with the next player you pass. To dodge naother player's swap, you can "dive". If the other player also dives, though, you'll swap anyway. If you both try to swap, nothing happens.

title: STRUNG OUT in heaven's high
tagline: hitting an all-time low
description: Do you remember a cat that's been in such an early game? We know
  that the cat was sent to space. Connected, monitorized, trapped in a tin can.
  A cat sent to die for the sake of science. High on catnip his brain envisioned
  adventures of space discovery, <strike>intergalactic battles, heroes and
  glory</strike>. But this is the final chapter of the Star Cats saga and the
  addiction to catnip is now out of control. Strung-out on heaven's high -
  hitting an all-time low - <strike>the little green wheels are following
  him</strike>.

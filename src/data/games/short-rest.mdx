TODO: full page description


> Somewhere outside a small village, nestled deep in the wood...
> An immortal dragon makes its den.
> The village calls on heroes: Noble, strong, and good...
> But they fall again and again.

A cute but deadly deckbuilding roguelike with unique spark. Carefully strategize as you make your way through the dragon's dungeon, and save the village from calamity!

- **Build and burn your deck:** Every card is precious, but some things are more precious than cards...
- **Battle your enemies:** Overcome dozens of turn-based encounters and unique bosses.
- **Bring your party to victory:** Learn to use each character's strengths to make it to the next camp; if your party falls, they'll have to start again!

> Adventures are just around the corner, so make sure your heroes are well rested...

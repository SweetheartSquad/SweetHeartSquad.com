A cute and laidback nightly farm simulator, where you grow strange and glorious flowers for a charming cast of characters. At night, use your action points to plant your garden, clear debris, and explore the forest. As your blood runs out, return to your crypt to dream the day away until sundown.

---

Bleak can be played in nightly segments, or at your own pace. You can choose whether game actions reset at midnight each real-time day, or just after sleeping in-game.

    Bleak is a farming sim and survival game in which you play as a vampire existing in solitude after those silly humans wiped themselves out. Manage your time and blood supply as you slowly cultivate the earth to once again become a place full of life.
